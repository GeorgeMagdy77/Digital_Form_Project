# croatia-configuration

The croatia-configuration repository is a [kustomization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/#kustomize-feature-list) repository desgined to run out of ArgoCD.

The overall design of the configuration management approach is documented [here in confluence](https://collab.dtme.dev/display/PC/Configuration+Management). The purpose of this repostory in this approach, is to create the configuration maps and secrets per-environment/cluster, that can be consumed by microservices.

## Deployment/Sync process

This repository is automatically synced with every environment when the trunk branch is changed. Each environment uses different version constraints on this repository, the specific versions called are specified in: https://bitbucket.projectcroatia.cloud/projects/DIG/repos/croatia-argocd/browse/argocd-applications/croatia-configuration.yaml. As such, once changes are merged to main for this repository, no further action is needed for the variables/secrets to become available in the environment

Deployments can be seen and monitored via ArgoCD with the name `${environment}-configuration`, for example, the development job can be found at: https://argocd.projectcroatia.cloud/applications/argocd/development-configuration?view=tree&resource=. This will always show the commit the environment is running on for the configuration

## Non sensitive configuration

Non sensitive configuration can be loaded into the `configmap.yaml` files at a per environment basis. For example, taking a microservice with an application.yaml looking like the following:
```
micronaut:
example-client:
  url: ${EXAMPLE_CLIENT:http://localhost:8080/}
```
Assuming that we then have different values needed for this for each environment, eg.
- Development = http://development.client/
- EIT/CIT = http://integration.client/

The update to the repository would then be to add these as keys in the appropriate `configmap.yaml` file. For example, to add the development value, one would edit the file `./overlays/development/configmap.yaml`, and append the following line to it:
`  EXAMPLE_CLIENT: http://development.client/`.
Once this change is merged to main, the applications will be automatically re-deployed/restarted, and the new value will be applied cia ArgoCD, and should be available after a short while.

## Sensitive configuration

Sensitive values should be held within our [Hashicorp vault instance](https://vault.ingress.san-sandbox.projectcroatia.cloud/)

This repository then uses [ExternalSecret](https://external-secrets.io/v0.7.2/api/externalsecret/) to sync the secret values in the environment against the vault instance.

The follow steps can be followed to add a new secret and/or change an existing secret in the environment:
1. Log into to [Vault](https://vault.ingress.san-sandbox.projectcroatia.cloud/) via the UI
2. Go into the folder for `alpha`
- For each environment in scope, go into the appropriate named folder
- In those environment folders, either add a new secret, or add the key/value pair to an existing secret
3. In this repository, go to the folder `overlays/${environment}/` for each environment
- For upated secrets, no further action is required
- For new secrets, the appropriate `ExternalSecret` object should be edited. The secret should be added as a new list item in `spec.data`, and look like the following
```
- secretKey: example_password # This is what we will reference in the implementing service
  remoteRef:
    key: alpha/development/database # This is the path to the secret in vault
    property: example_password # This the key of the key value pair within the secret
```
4. Commit the change to a branch, and go through the PR/review process to merge the change to main
5. Go to the application repository that is expecting to consume this secret
6. If a `values.yaml` file doesn't exist at the root of the repository already, create it
7. In that file, add a new line item to the `environmentConfiguration.secrets` element, referencing the item added in step 3. eg.
```
environmentConfiguration:
  secrets:
  - name: EXAMPLE_PASSWORD # The value referenced in the application.yml
    secretName: database # The name of the secret created, this comes from the `spec.target.name` field in the ExternalSecret object
    secretKey: example_password # The secretKey field set in step 3
```
8. Commit the change to a branch, and go through the PR/review process to merge the change to main
9. On the next deployment of the application, the secret value should be reflected by the application
